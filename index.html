        <h3>Project 1: Movie Recommendation System</h3>
        <p>
          Built a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and genre-based similarity matrices. The application recommends movies based on user input and lists the top 10 movies based on those methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project taught me about the Surprise library, a recommender systems library with built-in algorithms such as genre similarity matrices and collaborative filtering. 
          Additionally, Streamlit was my first attempt at building a web app, allowing me to experiment with API usage and interactive interfaces.

        <h3>Project 2: Lazy Calendar</h3>
        <p>
          An application to automate scheduling tasks, reminders, and calendar management. It uses Google Calendar API and sends reminders automatically. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This project taught me about OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and working with Google APIs for real-time calendar updates and notifications. It allowed me to improve my productivity and project management skills.

        <h3>Project 3: Machine Learning Application on HDB Housing Prices</h3>
        <p>
          Used Lasso, Ridge Regression, Linear Regression, and XGBoost Models to predict HDB Housing Prices. This project taught me how to handle multicollinearity and apply cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.
